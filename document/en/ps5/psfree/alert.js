// We can't just open a console on the ps4 browser, make sure the errors thrown
// by our modules are alerted. We use alert() instead of debug_log() because
// while we are developing, we may modify the utils.mjs module and introduce
// bugs. We can not use debug_log() if it throws an error.
//
// We added this new file instead of putting this on run.mjs, so we can ensure
// we can attach this listener first before running anything.
